# randomizer
We had a project that required short but frequent checks of a situation at the weekend, and nobody in the team wanted to volunteer.

So I drafted a super-quick randomizer script to allocate people to the project, based on what was needed when: we had a shared set of moments in which we had to update the stakeholders, and two versions of this checks, "light" and "full".
